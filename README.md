# "Calc" - a basic calculator app

## Description
This is a basic calculator app created in August 2023.

It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries were used this time - just plain old code.

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
When you arrive on the site, you can find the calculator itself smack dab in the middle of your screen. It works like most calculators do.

You can either start by clicking on the input field (at the top of the calculator) and then typing out your calculation via keyboard, or by manually clicking the buttons on the screen via mouse. Both options are fine: no pressure!

If you choose the latter, you'll notice the buttons will change the appearance of hover to appear as though they're being pressed, to more clearly indicate to you which button you're about to be clicking.

### The 'AC' & 'DE' buttons
'AC' stands for 'All Clear'.The AC button clears everything you've put into the input field. 

'DE' - which stands for 'Delete' - on the other hand removes only a single key/number. So where AC will scrap everything, DE will only remove the most recent keystroke.

### The '/', '*', '-', '+', and '=' buttons
'/' = divide 

'*' = multiply 

'-' = minus/take

'+' = plus/add

'=' = result of calculation

### The numbers
When you click on a number, it'll appear in the input field. You can click the same number as many times in a row as you want to.

## Status
The development of this project is complete for the foreseeable future.
